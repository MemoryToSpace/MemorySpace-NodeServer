# Memory to Space ðŸŒŒ

**Memory to Space** is a web service that allows users to generate and visualize memories as images. Users can input a memory (such as a personal experience at a specific location), and the service processes it through NLP (Natural Language Processing) to enhance the description. The memory is then converted into an image using OpenAI's DALL-E model. Users can also request to send the generated memory image to their email.
